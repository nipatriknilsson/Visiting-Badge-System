# Visiting-Badge-System

This is a Visiting Badge System done as a project during my classes at Lexicon Malm√∂ and demonstrates setting up a Ubuntu Linux Desktop (server) and installing necessary software to run it.

## Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS Installation

During this exercise a VirtualBox installation of Ubuntu 16.04 is used. You need to install one packet manually. In a terminal run:
```
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
```
The rest is remotely installed with ssh.
